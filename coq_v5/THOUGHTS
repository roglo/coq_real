Blocked in approach by division because I don't know how to prove the
commutativity between divisor and quotient in the division algorithm
(usual algorithm learned at school).

Blocked in approach by multiplication (normal approach) because I
don't know how to limit the carries. I just split multiplication into
multiplication algorithm (returning a sequence of numbers, instead of
sequence of digits) and propagation of the carry. The first step is
implemented (easy, I even proved it was commutative). The second step
poses problems.
